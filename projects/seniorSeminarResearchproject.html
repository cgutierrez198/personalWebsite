    <h1>Project Abstract</h1>
    
    <p>  
    
In this project, we create a program to scrape the stock data from a list of 
fortune 500 stocks and write a script to scrape the search
results from the google trends website. Using the Yahoo Finance API, we can verify 
that a stock ticker is being used and pull the
historical data for that company. For the Google Trends, we use the gtrendsR API 
to pull the search results for 445 companies and then
combine those results into a single file. The data from these two methods are 
then put into comma separated value files and parsed by the
java program for plotting. The overall goal of this project is to see if there 
are reoccurring signs of correlation between stock price and
google trends and also consider if trends for a company will impact its closing 
price in the negative or positive manner.
