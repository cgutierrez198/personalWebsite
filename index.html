     <h1>About This Site</h1>
	<p>
	
	Website is for my own personal development, somewhere I can go to test
	out things for a website and to improve my own personal mark-up skills.
	The site is laid out so that I have an area for showing future employment
	where my projects are and the research I have worked on over the course
	of my computer science degree, events I have taken apart of, and where I
	have made presentations. Of course this is mostly for my own benefit and
	I will maybe use it as my own personal blog related to programming
	ventures.
